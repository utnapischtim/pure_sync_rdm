    Changes: gets from Pure API 'changes' endpoint all the changes that took place in a certain date and updates accordingly the RDM repository
    Updates: gets from Pure API 'research-outputs' endpoint all the last modified records (alternative to 'Changes')
    Pages:   gets from Pure API 'research-outputs' endpoint all records divided by pages (used only for first full transfer)

    This information will be used to check whas the last successful 'Changes' or 'Updates' process.

C:  Status of metadata transmitted to RDM.

D:  Status of file transmitted to RDM (which is related to a previously transmitted metadata)

E:  Status of records deleted from RDM. Field not used in 'Pages' and 'Update' processes

F:  Lines F - H will be created only for 'Changes' process.

G:  Update, create and delete refere to the <changeType> specified in the response from Pure.

H:  Incomplete: when <uuid>, <changeType> or <familySystemName> fields are missing
    Duplicated: when a record has been modified multiple times then it is enough to update RDM only once..
    Irrelevant: when <familySystemName> has a different value then 'ResearchOutput'
